It's a coding challenge given by  itemis Ag. Three problems  
1: SALES TAXES .  
2: CONFERENCE TRACK MANAGEMENT.  
3: MERCHANT'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY

## Problem 1: SALES TAXES
Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical
products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax
applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions. When I purchase items
I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items and their price (including tax),
finishing with the total cost of the items,
and the total amounts of sales taxes paid. The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax
rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains (np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of
sales tax.

## Problem 2: CONFERENCE TRACK MANAGEMENT
You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals which
have passed the initial screen process but you're having trouble fitting them into the time
constraints of the day -- there are so many possibilities! So you write a program to do it for
you.

## Problem 3: MERCHANT'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY
You decided to give up on earth after the latest financial collapse left 99.99% of the earth's
population with 0.01% of the wealth. Luckily, with the scant sum of money that is left in your
account, you are able to afford to rent a spaceship, leave earth, and fly all over the galaxy to
sell common metals and dirt (which apparently is worth a lot).
Buying and selling over the galaxy requires you to convert numbers and units, and you
decided to write a program to help you.
The numbers used for intergalactic transactions follows similar convention to the roman
numerals and you have painstakingly collected the appropriate translation between them.
